# hello_world

A list of "Hello, World!" projects written in different languages that I have made to demonstrate knowledge of low-level concepts.

### exec_page

A program that takes a `__uint128_t` value, of which is a type-punned "`Hello, World!\n`" string literal, and passes this value as an argument of type `__uint128_t *` into machine code, of which is stored in bytes in an `unsigned char[]`, copied to an executable page, instantiated into, and called by a function pointer.

Previous iterations of the program have been kept in the directory.
